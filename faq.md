## What is this game?
Moo is my (hawthornbunny's) personal variant of the rule-changing card game better known as Mao.

Moo is a game of observation and deduction in which all rules are initially kept secret, and players have to figure them out as they play. Players are not expected, nor required, to know the rules beforehand (although by necessity, at least one player must). When a player wins, they get to invent and add a new secret rule to the game on top of the existing ones, causing the game to mutate unpredictably the longer it is played.

## Why did you make your own ruleset?
I found that there are very few places on the internet that actually tell you how to play Mao, aside from the ones I've written myself in various places on the internet. I love the game and wanted to create a well-defined version that people can take away and use themselves.

## Why did you rename the game from "Mao" to "Moo"?
One problem I have with Mao is that the name sounds political, which I believe may mislead people into thinking it's a game about politics, or some kind of satire. It isn't. Mao has absolutely nothing to do with politics at all. I have suspected that the name alone might put people off playing it, so I decided to rename it to the more neutral "Moo" (an onomatopaeia for the sound made by a cow).

## Why did you call it "Moo"?
The name comes from a My Little Pony fanfiction I wrote named "Manehattan Moo", in which six ponies play a game of Mao. Since the name "Mao" doesn't really map to anything in a land of magical talking ponies, I called it "Moo" instead, since that was the closest vaguely equine-related name I could think of.

I soon realized that I actually really liked this as an alternative name for Mao, which better fits the way I see the game; it's more frivolous and playful. Since I was deciding on my own ruleset anyway, I figured why not change the name too?

## What is the "Great Bovine Deity"?
In the original Mao, saying the name of the game while you're playing earns a 3-card penalty, the harshest in the game. The penalty call for this is "Taking the name of the leader in vain".

It's never explained who the "leader" is supposed to be, but since the name of the game is "Mao", it's pretty easy to assume that this refers to Chairman Mao Zedong, the Founder of the People's Republic of China. As I explained in a previous point, this gives the game a political undertone which I don't like.

However, I did want to keep the rule, since I really like it - so, to avoid the political implications, I invented the Great Bovine Deity, an unspecified supernatural agent which shares its name with the game. Using its name frivolously is considered blasphemous, and thus the player receives a 3-card penalty for saying "Moo" during the game (unless they are doing so to win, which pleases the deity).

The idea of a mysterious, ineffable deity who is somehow invested in the happenings of a silly card game also feels very appropriate to me - in fact, this could even justify the reason for all the weird rules and secrecy in the first place.

Like the name "Moo", the concept of the Great Bovine Deity also originated in my My Little Pony fanfiction, "Manehattan Moo".

## How do you win the game?
Moo doesn't really have a concept of a winner, as such. Players aren't playing toward an end goal - they're just playing for the opportunity to cause chaos with interesting new rules.

## Why doesn't the game stop when someone wins?
There are 2 ways you can play Mao: you can play it in rounds, like UNO, where the cards are redealt whenever someone wins, or you can play it in a more continuous form, where the game never truly stops. I find the second way to be a far more "Mao-like" experience and was keen to make that a part of the Moo ruleset.

The main advantage of not having rounds is that it avoids destroying the progress of other players, since the remaining players don't have to abandon their cards when someone else wins. This avoids the frustration of having victory snatched away from you.

It also makes the game much more fluid; people can enter the game at any point without having to wait for a round to end, for example. (Jumping directly into a game in progress without knowing any of the rules is, indeed, a very Mao-like thing to do!). This makes for a much better party game atmosphere and it works well in places like conventions where you can't guarantee the availability of players. It also avoids the problem of having to wait for someone to come up with a new rule, since you can keep playing while they think of one.

## What are Moo Tokens?
Moo Tokens are my way of formalizing the privilege of introducing new rules.

In regular Mao, if you win by getting rid of all your cards, it's just kind of assumed that you have the power to create a new rule and that you'll do so, but nobody really keeps track of who has this privilege. I wanted to make this more formal, so the rules of Moo state that when a player wins, they earn one Moo Token, and they may spend it at any time to introduce a new rule.

This makes it easier for players to defer rule creation if they want, since it's not always easy to think of new rules and some people may just want to play the game instead of being forced to make a new rule immediately. It also opens the possibility for players to be generous and donate Moo Tokens to players who want to introduce new rules, but haven't been able to win the game to do so.

Moo Tokens are not intended to be physical objects, although there's nothing stopping people from using physical tokens if they want.

## What is "unsporting conduct"?
Moo allows players to penalize others for "unsporting conduct" if they are not playing fair (for example, perhaps they are trying to trick newbies into inadvertently breaking the rules). However, the game doesn't define what counts as unsporting, and instead leaves it up to the players to decide.

The purpose of this rule is simply to make it clear that good behavior is expected during the game.

The definition of unsporting conduct is intentionally left undefined - players can decide for themselves what this means.

The purpose of this rule is to give players a way to enforce good behavior from others, and to make it clear that good behavior is expected during the game.

Of course, this raises the question: what's to stop a misbehaving player from declaring all behavior to be "unsporting", and hitting everyone with this penalty? Well, in that case, players can use a Point of Order to call a vote on whether to uphold the penalty or not. A misbehaving player would be outvoted by the majority.

## What if a player introduces a new rule that overrides or destroys one of my rules?
This is possible in Moo, as the rules state that newer rules always take precedence over preceding rules in the event of a conflict. This is deliberate - it is done this way to provide a simple way to resolve rule conflicts. However, it does mean that another player could, accidentally or deliberately, use their new rule to squash an existing rule.

The best way to resolve this is to call a point of order to discuss it, and if necessary vote to amend the rule.

## Is this a drinking game?
No. While Mao/Moo has some similarities to a drinking game (ie. arbitrary rules that players are penalized for breaking), I have never played it as one, and I don't really feel it's suitable for doing so. Players do need to focus on the game in order to keep track of what's going on - deducing rules from observation is not easy! Also, in drinking games, having to drink is considered a forfeit, and I don't really like to equate penalties with forfeits. Receiving a penalty in Mao is not supposed to be merely a punishment - it's how players learn the rules.

## How do you end the game?
Moo intentionally has no end condition, since the point of the game is for it to get crazier the longer it goes on. However, because the game has no round structure, it's pretty easy to wind down - the remaining players just have to agree to finish.

## Can I use your ruleset?
Of course! Nobody owns Mao, and so nobody owns Moo either. I did not even invent most of these rules myself; I have merely tried to formalize them. You can use these rules as is, or modify them in any way you like. If you don't like the name "Moo", you can call it whatever you want.

## This game is really unfair on newbies who don't know the rules. Why not just explain the rules upfront?
The asymmetry between newbies and experienced players is intentional. I don't like to characterize it as "unfairness", since the point of this asymmetry is to give newbies a chance to face the true challenge of Moo - figuring out rules from observation. Explaining the rules upfront would deny people this challenge, and it also robs the game of one of its core benefits - the fact that you don't _have_ to know the rules to play.
