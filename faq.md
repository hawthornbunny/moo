# FAQ

## What is this game?
Moo is my (hawthornbunny's) personal variant of the rule-changing card game better known as Mao.

Moo is a game of observation and deduction in which all rules are initially kept secret, and players have to figure them out as they play. Players are not expected, nor required, to know the rules beforehand (although by necessity, at least one player must). When a player wins, they get to invent and add a new secret rule to the game on top of the existing ones, causing the game to mutate unpredictably the longer it is played.

## Why did you make your own ruleset?
Mao is quite a well-known game in geek circles, but I found that there are not many resources that actually tell you how to play, aside from the ones I've written myself in various places on the internet. I've always loved the game and wanted to create a well-defined version that people can take away and use themselves, while at the same time trying to remove some of the game's more contentious aspects.

## Why did you rename the game from "Mao" to "Moo"?
The biggest problem I have with Mao is the name - it makes the game sound like it's about politics, or is some kind of political satire. This is unfortunate, as that's not what Mao is at all - the game has absolutely nothing to do with politics.

To avoid people being put off by the name, I decided to rename it to the more neutral, friendly-sounding "Moo" (an onomatopaeia for the sound made by a cow).

## Why did you call it "Moo"?
The name comes from a My Little Pony fanfiction I wrote named *[Manehattan Moo](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/203141/manehattan-moo)*, in which six ponies play a game of Mao. Since the name "Mao" doesn't really mean anything in a land of magical talking ponies, I called it "Moo" instead, since that was the closest vaguely equine-related name I could think of.

However I soon realized that I actually really liked this as an alternative name for Mao, which better fits the way I see the game; it's more frivolous and playful. Since I was deciding on my own ruleset anyway, I figured why not change the name too?

## What is the "Great Bovine Deity"?
In the original Mao, saying the name of the game while you're playing earns a 3-card penalty, the harshest in the game. The penalty call for this is "Taking the name of the leader in vain".

It's never explained who the "leader" is supposed to be, but since the name of the game is "Mao", it's pretty easy to assume that this refers to Chairman Mao Zedong, the Founder of the People's Republic of China. As I explained in a previous point, this gives the game a political undertone which I don't like.

However, I did want to keep the "don't say the name of the game" rule, since I really like it - so, to avoid the political implications, I invented the Great Bovine Deity, an unspecified supernatural agent which shares its name with the game. I then realized that incorporating the deity into the game's theming actually ties a lot of things together quite nicely, by giving a plausible reason for all the weird rules and secrecy in the first place.

So, with that said, here's some official theming for the game:

_The Great Bovine Deity is a mysterious supernatural being who watches over all games of Moo. The deity protects and nurtures new players, encouraging them to be bold in their actions, and never afraid to make mistakes. The deity is displeased by anyone who would play unfair, or who would treat newbies badly._

_Players can achieve victory by speaking the true name of the Great Bovine Deity when the time is right. However, saying the deity's name at any other time will incur their wrath and result in the harshest penalty._

Like the name "Moo", the concept of the Great Bovine Deity also originated in my My Little Pony fanfiction, *Manehattan Moo*.

## What are Moo Tokens?
Moo Tokens are a way of formalizing the privilege of introducing new rules.

In regular Mao, if you win by getting rid of all your cards, it's just kind of assumed that you have the power to create a new rule and that you'll do so, but nobody really keeps track of who has this privilege. I wanted to make this more formal, so the rules of Moo state that when a player wins, they earn one Moo Token, and they may spend it at any time to introduce a new rule.

This makes it easier for players to defer rule creation if they want, since it's not always easy to think of new rules and some people may just want to play the game instead of being forced to make a new rule immediately. With Moo Tokens, they can just save the token and spend it when they're ready. It also opens the possibility for players to be generous and donate Moo Tokens to players who want to introduce new rules, but haven't been able to win the game to do so.

Moo Tokens are not intended to be physical objects, although there's nothing stopping people from using physical tokens to represent them if they want to.

## What if a player gets rid of all their cards, but doesn't know they have to say "Moo" to win?
This event is unlikely but possible, in the rare situation where a newbie manages to successfully play all their cards despite not knowing the rules. Moo resolves this situation by giving a cryptic penalty if the player fails to say "Moo": "Failure to say the name of the Great Bovine Deity". This will force the player to take a penalty card, which gives at least another round of turns before the situation comes up again, in which time hopefully the player will have figured out what they need to do.

If it comes to it, you can simply explain to the player that they need to say the name of the game to win.

## What is "unsporting conduct"?
Moo allows players to penalize others for "unsporting conduct" if they are not playing fair (for example, perhaps they are trying to trick newbies into inadvertently breaking the rules). However, the game doesn't define what counts as unsporting, and instead leaves it up to the players to decide.

The real purpose of this rule is not to prevent unsporting behavior, but rather to message to players that unsporting behavior is discouraged. If someone really refuses to behave, you probably shouldn't be playing with them anyway.

## What if a player introduces a new rule that overrides or destroys one of my rules?
In Moo, new rules can always override preceding rules, including ones created by other people. This was a deliberate decision in order to allow the game to be fully mutable.

However, it does mean that another player's rule could completely undo or nullify one of yours. If that's something you don't want, consider calling a Point of Order to discuss it, and if necessary vote to amend the rule. Don't assume malice - the player may simply not have realized what they've done (they may not even know what your rule is).

## Is this a drinking game?
No. While Mao/Moo has some similarities to a drinking game (ie. arbitrary rules that players are penalized for breaking), I have never played it as one, and I don't really feel it's suitable for doing so. Players do need to focus on the game in order to keep track of what's going on - deducing rules from observation is not easy! Also, in drinking games, having to drink is considered a forfeit, and I don't really like to equate penalties with forfeits. Receiving a penalty in Mao is not supposed to be merely a punishment - it's how players learn the rules.

## Why doesn't the game stop when someone wins?
There are two ways you can play Mao: round-based, where the cards are redealt whenever someone wins (like UNO), or continuous, where the game never truly stops. I find the second way to be the far more "Mao-like" experience, and was keen to make that a part of the Moo ruleset.

The main advantage of not having rounds is that it avoids destroying the progress of other players, since the remaining players don't have to abandon their cards when someone else wins. This avoids the frustration of having victory snatched away from you, and it allows the possibility for multiple new rules to suddenly enter the game, which I like because it's more chaotic.

It also makes the game much more fluid; people can enter the game at any point without having to wait for a round to end, for example. (Jumping directly into a game in progress without knowing any of the rules is, indeed, a very Moo-like thing to do!). This makes for a much better party game atmosphere, and it works well in places like conventions where you can't guarantee the availability of players. It also avoids the problem of having to wait for someone to come up with a new rule, since you can keep playing while they think of one.

## How do you end the game?
Moo intentionally has no end condition, since the point of the game is for it to get crazier the longer it goes on. However, because the game has no round structure, it's pretty easy to wind down - the remaining players just have to agree to finish.

## How long should games of Moo last?
I recommend at least a couple of hours - enough time for everyone involved to learn the rules if they need to, and for everyone to get a chance at creating their own rule. However, Moo is fully intended to be played for as long as you want. Back when I first played Mao, we used to set aside an entire day for the game.

## What kinds of rules can I create?
Anything you like! Ideally, something that's easy to understand once you know it, challenging to deduce if you don't, and that will catch players out if they aren't paying attention. Here's an example:

> If 3 cards of the same rank are played on top of each other, the player who plays the third card must say "Praise the Great Bovine Deity".

This is a speech rule that is triggered by the uncommon, but not too rare occurrence of three cards of the same rank being played in succession. The first time someone triggers the rule, if they don't say the required phrase, you can penalize them with the penalty call "Failure to say 'Praise the Great Bovine Deity'". That way, the player will know _what_ to do, but won't know why (but they have a good chance of guessing, if they noticed that the top three cards have the same rank).

When it comes to making rules, the only constraints are that they have to be fair and deducible - you can't make a rule that favors specific players, and you can't make a rule that nobody could possibly figure out. Remember that you can use the penalty call as a hint for your rule.

It's also highly recommended to keep rules simple - in particular, avoid making rules that have lots of different conditions. These are difficult to enforce, especially in a game where lots of other rules may be interacting with each other.

If you feel you made a mistake when creating your rule, you can always call a Point of Order to discuss it, and can vote to amend it if needed.

## Can I use your ruleset?
Absolutely! I'd love it if people use these rules. While I formalized the ruleset and invented the thematic elements, I do not "own" the game as it's a traditional card game. You can use these rules as is, modify them in any way you like, or create your own version based on it. If you don't like the name "Moo", you can call it whatever you want.

## This game is really unfair on newbies who don't know the rules. Why not just explain the rules upfront?
The asymmetry between newbies and experienced players is fully intentional. I don't like to characterize it as "unfairness", since the point of this asymmetry is to give newbies a chance to face the true challenge of Moo - figuring out rules from observation. Explaining the rules upfront would deny people this challenge, and it also robs the game of one of its core benefits - the fact that you don't _have_ to know the rules to play.

## Are there any other games like Moo?
Many! It depends on what you mean by "like Moo". I identify three aspects as being fundamental to Moo:

* **Rule-changing:** The rules of the game change as it's played.
* **Invention**: New rules are invented (or existing rules amended) by players.
* **Secrecy:** Rules are hidden from players and must be discovered during play.

Here's a list of games which include some or all of these aspects:

* **Bartok:** A traditional card game which is a very close relative of Mao - it uses the same initial card validity rules, and also allows players to add new rules when they get rid of all their cards. The main difference is that Bartok drops the secrecy requirement, so there's no need for players to deduce rules. If you don't like the secrecy in Moo, Bartok might be the game for you!
* **Nomic:** A game of law invented by Peter Suber in 1982. Nomic is perhaps the purest form of rule-changing game - it's basically a set of rules that allow players to amend those rules each turn. Games of Nomic are really more of a law playground, where players continually try to twist the game into legal knots. Moo is far less formal than Nomic, but tries to retain that playful, creative atmosphere.
* **1000 Blank White Cards:** A game where players create the deck themselves by writing rules on blank cards. The game starts with a mix of pre-made and blank cards, and players can create new cards as they play. Like Moo, the game is less about winning and more about the chaos of an unpredictable, mutable game.
* **Dvorak:** This is similar to 1000 Blank White Cards in that players create the deck from blank cards; however, it is more formal, and defines what kinds of object are allowed to exist in the game. It is also a little closer to Nomic in that it requires players to vote on what cards are allowed in game. Rules: <https://dvorakgame.co.uk/index.php/Main_Page>
* **Fluxx:** A commercial card game with a predefined deck, which has special "New Rule" cards that change aspects of the game while it's being played.
* **Mini Mao:** A minimalistic Mao variant invented by Kevan Davis in 2002. Mini Mao strips away most of Mao's procedural rules, and focuses more tightly on the secret rule deduction aspect. Mini Mao's rule-changing rules are more restrictive and do not permit self-modification of the game's own rules, which are known to all players in advance. This makes Mini Mao far less chaotic than Mao or Moo, but still provides a fun creative and deductive challenge. It's also much fairer on newbies, as all players start with equal knowledge of the game. Rules: <https://kevan.org/games/minimao.php>
**Rumble**: A combat game where players invent superpowers (which are expressed as additions or amendments to the game rules), and then bid energy to gain those powers. The bidding system helps to regulate the game and ensure it doesn't just become a free-for-all of who can invent the most game-breaking power first. Rules: <https://kevan.org/rumble/hero/rules>
