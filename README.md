Last updated: 8th December 2022

## Introduction
This is a complete set of rules for the card game Moo, a variant of the rule-changing card game known as Mao.

* [Frequently Asked Questions](faq.md)

## Rules of Moo

### 1. Prerequisites
100. Moo is played with 1 or more decks of standard playing cards, including jokers. If many people are playing, using multiple decks is recommended to ensure a good stock of cards. Decks do not need to have the same back.
101. At least one player needs to know the rules of Moo.

### 2. Starting the game
200. A player who knows the rules of Moo should start the game by taking the following steps:
     * Shuffle all cards and place them face-down to create the draw pile.
     * Deal out 5 face-down cards to each player for their starting hands.
     * Formally announce the start of the game. Here is an example opening preamble: "We are now playing the game of Moo. In this game, all rules are secret, except for these three: Players take turns in a clockwise direction, you may pick up a card if you cannot play, and the Joker is the 9 of Diamonds."
     * Take a card from the draw pile and lay it face up to start the play pile.

### 3. Gameplay
300. Players take turns, starting with the player on the dealer's left and continuing in a clockwise order.
301. A turn consists of the following:
     * The player must either play a valid card face-up to the play pile, or draw one card from the draw pile.
     * The player must take all other actions required of them on their turn, if any.
302. A card is valid if it has the same rank or suit as the last played card.
303. If a player has no cards remaining in their hand, and has no remaining actions left to perform, and has not committed any infractions for which they could be penalized, they may say "Moo" to earn one Moo Token, and leave the game. If they meet all of these conditions but do not say "Moo", they do not earn a Moo Token, but still leave the game.
304. People who are not in the game are not bound by the rules of Moo and cannot be penalized. They still retain any Moo Tokens they earned during that game.
305. People who are not in the game may join (or rejoin) the game by dealing themselves 5 cards from the draw pile.
306. A player may voluntarily donate a Moo Token to another player.
307. If the draw pile is exhausted, take all but the top card of the play pile, turn those cards face-down, and shuffle them. Those cards become the new draw pile.
308. Players may leave the game at any time. If they do, their card hand should be shuffled back into the draw pile.

### 4. Card rules
400. If a player plays an Ace, the next player's turn is skipped.
401. If a player plays a 7, they must say "Have a nice day". On the next player's turn, instead of playing/drawing a card as usual, that player must either say "Thank you" and draw a card, or they may also play a 7 and say "Have a very nice day", in which case the next player must either say "Thank you very much" and draw 2 cards, or also play a 7. This loop repeats for as long as subsequent players are able to play 7s, with the number of "very"s and the number of cards drawn increasing by one each time.
402. If a player plays an 8, the turn order is reversed.
403. If a Jack is played, any player may call out the name of a suit. The next card played must either be of that suit, or another Jack.
404. If a player plays a Spade, they must say the name of the card they played (eg. "4 of Spades").
405. If a player plays the 9 of Diamonds, they must say "That's the bovine".
406. Playing a Joker is considered to be equivalent to playing a 9 of Diamonds.

### 5. Giving penalties
500. If a player breaks a rule, any player may give them a penalty by saying a formal penalty call which corresponds to the infraction committed, and giving the offending player one face-down card from the draw pile.
     * 500.1. Players cannot be penalized more than once for the same instance of an infraction.
     * 500.2. If a single action by a player breaks multiple rules at the same time, they may be given separate penalties for each rule broken.
     * 500.3. Players may penalize their own infractions.
501. If a player calls an invalid penalty, they may be penalized, with the penalty call "Bad call". The penalty they were going to give is voided.
     * 501.1. A penalty is invalid if the player being penalized did not commit the infraction referred to in the penalty call.
     * 501.2. A penalty is invalid if it is not issued within a short time of the infraction.
502. If a penalty is voided or revoked, any penalty cards that resulted from the penalty must be returned to the draw pile face down. Shuffle the draw pile if necessary.
503. Some rules require actions to be taken immediately. Players must be given a feasible amount of time to complete these actions, and cannot be penalized for failing to complete them if they have not been given sufficient time to do so.

### 6. Introducing new rules
600. If a player has any Moo Tokens, they may spend one and say "Introducing new rule" to add a new secret rule to the game. If the rule is one that can be broken, the player should also invent an appropriate penalty call for players who break it.
601. If a new rule conflicts with an existing rule, the new rule takes precedence.
602. If a rule is invalid, it is considered void and players do not have to follow it.
     * 602.1. If a rule would not be applicable to all players equally once everyone has full knowledge of the rule, it is invalid.
     * 602.2. If a rule is not deducible, either from observation or from information provided in the penalty call, it is invalid.

### 7. Speech rules
700. If a rule requires the player to say something, and they do not say it, they may be penalized with the penalty call "Failure to say (X)", where (X) is the thing they did not say. If they continue to fail to say the required thing, they may be penalized again after a short time with the penalty call "Continued failure to say (X)".
701. If multiple rules require the player to say things at the same time, they must say all of them, or be penalized for the ones they did not say. The player may choose which order to say the things in, with the exception of saying "Moo" to earn a Moo Token, which must be the last thing said before leaving the game.

### 8. Point of Order rules
800. If a player says "Point of Order" and a Point of Order is not currently in progress, a Point of Order is started.
801. Players must put down their cards at the start of a Point of Order, and must not touch them while the Point of Order is in progress. If they do, they may be penalized with the penalty call "Touching cards during a P of O".
802. During a Point of Order, normal gameplay is suspended. Players cannot play cards, the turn order does not advance, and the time limit for playing cards does not apply. All other rules remain in effect.
803. Players must not say "Point of Order" during a Point of Order, other than when making the call to end it. If they do, they may be penalized with the penalty call "Saying P of O in a P of O".
804. A player may propose a vote in a Point of Order. Votes may be used to change any aspect of the game, including amending or removing rules, or reversing penalty decisions. If a majority of players agree, the vote passes and the game changes accordingly.
805. To end a Point of Order, any player may say "End of Point of Order". Gameplay resumes from where it was stopped.
     * 805.1. The 10 second turn timer is restarted when resuming play after a Point of Order.

### 9. Other infractions
900. If the rules say that a player must do something, and they do not do it, they may be penalized with a penalty call "Failure to (X)", where (X) is the thing they did not do. If they continue to fail to do the required thing, they may be penalized again with the penalty call "Repeated failure to (X)". This continues until they do the required thing.
901. On a player's turn, if they do not play a card or pick up a card from the draw pile within 10 seconds, they may be penalized with the penalty call "Failure to play within 10 seconds". If they continue to fail to play, they may be penalized with "Continued failure to play within 10 seconds" for each additional 10 seconds that they fail to play.
902. If a player plays a card when it is not their turn, they may be penalized with the penalty call "Playing out of turn". Their play is not considered valid. They must take back any cards that they played.
903. If a player has only one card remaining in their hand, they must say "Last card". If they do not, they may be penalized with the penalty call "Failure to say 'Last card'".
904. If a player says "Moo" at any time other than when starting the game or when correctly doing so to earn a Moo Token, they may be penalized with the penalty call "Taking the name of the Great Bovine Deity in vain". For this and only this infraction, the penalty is 3 cards instead of the usual 1.
905. If a player says something which is untrue, they may be penalized with the call "Lying". This applies even if the untruth is unintentional.
906. If a player explains any rule of the game, they may be penalized with the penalty call "Explaining the rules".
907. If a player performs an action which is considered unsporting, they may be penalized with the penalty call "Unsporting conduct". Players may use their own discretion to decide what is unsporting.
908. If a player performs an action which is considered to be cheating, they may be penalized with the penalty call "Cheating". In addition to the definitions of cheating provided in these rules, players may use their own discretion to to decide what is cheating.
      * 908.1. Discarding or removing a card from one's hand in any way not permitted by the rules, is cheating.
      * 908.2. Reordering the play pile is cheating.
      * 908.3. Peeking at or manipulating another player's hand cards without their consent is cheating.
